V1 (15 mins)
Lets build a photo browser, shows photos with pagination
Now, we want to filter the photos by tag, still with pagination -> Reuse?
Now, we want to show a list of employees, 10 at a time -> Reuse?
problems: global state, logic/view/data all intermingled

V2(10 mins)
Extract everything into a class -> why?
No global state -> why?
However, this is not the right approach, as multiple copies of methods are copied -> why?

V3 (15 mins)
Prototype -> what?
Reusable -> how?
Namespace -> why?
$name -> why?
testing -> how?
Handlebars -> how?/why?
